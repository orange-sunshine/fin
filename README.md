This is an open repository of trading strategies that I build and test on historical data. 

Feel free to shoot any ideas you would like me to implement at sury@berkeley.edu! 

Todos: 
1. Benchmarking strategies and storing performance data for comparisons
2. Live performance of strategies on the market that automatically get updated
